        <h1>About Project</h1>
        <article>
            <!-- Link to picture of project -->
            <!--img src="" alt="your picture" -->

            <p>S.P.A.R.K.S aims at providing a smart energy management
system, especially when natural disasters strike; essentially taking over gas or diesel
generators. The project sports a three-way tie between a battery bank, solar panels,
and the electrical power grid. The smart system should be able to automatically
charge the battery bank and reserve the power for when it is needed. This will result
in peak load shaving which will provide PV / battery grid tie systems with larger
flexibility and reliability. Making peak load shaving a priority based on time of use
pricing will allow the utility to easily predict when they can expect discharge onto the
grid, as well as turn on as soon as it is needed. One of the project's functions will
feature a web portal that can show the system's data and status. The software side of
the product should predict when to buy or sell energy from the grid, optimizing the
user's energy to dollar ratio.</p>

            <p>The portal is a webserver running on the Raspberry Pi. It contains temperature
readings, current and voltage measurements that are read from the hardware
components. From this portal, the client will have a dashboard that displays the GPIO
Pins, which turn mechanical relays on or off. The portal aims at giving individuals
remote access and control of their installations, with the feasibility of determining
which source is powering their load. In the back end, the use of HTML and socket.io
within an MQTT broker are used for data management will allow for storage and
display of data, should the user request it.
In terms of hardware, a two in one inverter/controller will control the flow of
energy. The switches that channel the power generated either into the battery bank or
directly into the house/load will be defaulted in an auto-pilot mode where the smart
system will control them. The installation(s) will also have a manual mode, where the
user will control the flow of energy as they see fit.
Information collected from weather station, temperature sensors, DC meters, AC
meters as well as time of use pricing information will be retrieved by wireless
microcontrollers. The microcontrollers will send the information to the central unit
(data logger) for the information to be processed and stored. Based on the preset
conditions, current conditions and algorithm constraints it will control the various
relays. </p>

            <p>The concept of solar energy has been exponentially developed in recent years.
With many programs, such as Sunshot, launched in an effort to make solar energy
more affordable, there has been an approximate decrease in cost of 65%. Any method
that increases the turn-around of the investment increases profitability of a solar
installation and is worth pursuing. A system that can effectively reduce the cost of the
energy consumed, as well as help disaster victims, will most certainly help an
investor of solar energy quickly make money on his or her installations.
Many software licenses that are seen in the market that are used for power and
data management in solar installations can only manage data. But are used mostly for
daily use, and not for aiding natural disaster victims and assuring they get power even
when there is none.</p>

<p>S.P.A.R.K.S is a connection of many different components of
hardware, as well as the integration of an innovative software concept. It will provide
the customer maximum control of their system while seamlessly integrating into the
electrical grid. The concept includes two different types of solar generation, one with
PV-Thermal panels and the other conventional panels. A battery bank built with lead 
6
acid batteries for the storage of unused energy. A simple grid tie inverter connecting
the three energy sources will invert the generated DC power into AC to either feed
the load or return the excess to the grid. The charge controller will convert from AC
to DC to charge the battery bank.
In order to replace the traditional gas/diesel powered generator, we need
something just as powerful that will provide the proper energy safely and effectively.
What the solar powered generator offers is renewable energy, an environmentally
friendly alternative, and cost savings in the long run. To sum up it is a connection of
many different pieces of hardware, a well working integration of software, used in
combination to create a safe, easy to use, and efficient solar powered system. It will
provide the user control of their system while seamlessly integrating into the electrical
network provided by the utility company. The system will provide enough energy for
the system and will also provide energy back to the grid when not in use or in times of
battery drainage for effective power management.</p>

<p>Due to our high dependability on electricity, the different stages of our electrical
grid must not only be extremely reliable, but also environmentally friendly. As little
as only 4% of Florida's power grid is composed of renewable energy sources, with
the remaining 96% coming from nuclear reactions, and fuel burning. Yet, after
analyzing many of the reliability issues with renewable sources, we understand why
such a small portion of our grid has made the transition into renewable energy.
One of the issues that the current renewable energies face is their high
dependency on the weather patterns, and our inability to compensate with accurate
weather predictions. Moreover, another issue that hasn't been resolved is solar panels
taking over gas or diesel generators when natural disasters strike, which our project
aims to address these issues.</p>

                <p>Hardware implementation within this specific design is essential because
an interconnection is going to be established between solar PV panels, the power
grid, and battery. The main electrical/hardware interconnection is going to consist
of a smart inverter, smart energy meter, and battery. Nonetheless, solar panels are
well known to be efficient and unreliable, which is why these devices below will
be implemented in order to increase the PV efficiency:

*PV panel which at maximum outputs 240W or 300W on a cloudy day.
*Two inverters powered by the system itself (Boost and DC-AC).
*Four AC relays placed in between all hardware connections for safety
(two 240A relays and two 100A relays).
*Smart Meter with RodBus RTC communication output
*300V battery with in-line fuse for protection
*Raspberry Pi for wireless communication, data storage and
maintenance management.
*Aluminum chassis and rack with other small components.</p>

                <p>Software implementation will be just as important as the hardware. The
system will be connected to the Internet constantly, so the main difficulty will be
to design a secure system. This includes Database and Server threats that can
reveal private information. Most of the software will be handwritten excluding the
smart meter. The smart meter simplifies the data collection tremendously as it
physically collects and export information as a JSON package. All code will be
published online for evaluation and efficiency suggestion via Github. Below are
all the minimal requirement needed to inform the user of the systems health in
real-time:
*Smart Meter data logs and exports as a JSON package via ModbusRTU
reading will be done by Raspberry Pi and collected locally.
*Connection to FPL servers will be through an EIA client named Pyiso.
FPL data will be collected by API request via WattTime API. API
calls will be encrypted using MD5.
*Smart Meter and FPL data will be stored in a local MySQL database
and sent through a MySQL Server hosted by the Raspberry Pi.
*Users can view and access data through a web based GUI interface.
GUI interface will be managed and designed by a framework, Python
Flask
*Web services will be run by a Apache server hosted by the Raspberry
Pi. </p>
